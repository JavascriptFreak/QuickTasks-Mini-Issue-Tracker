# QuickTasks-Mini-Issue-Tracker

## Goal: A polished, small full-stack app showing your ability to:
1. Build with Quarkus and Vue.js
2. Work like an open source contributor (issues, reviews, commits)
3. Handle both frontend and backend tasks

## Setup project (quarkus:dev, RESTEasy) - Backend Application
1. Create Task entity with fields:
  id, title, description, status
2. Implement basic REST endpoints:
● GET /tasks
● POST /tasks
● PUT /tasks/{id} (to update status)

## Create a Vue app with:
1. Task input form
2. Task list view
3. Status dropdown for each task (e.g., "open", "in progress", "done")
4. Fetch data from Quarkus REST API using Axios
