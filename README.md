# QuickTasks-Mini-Issue-Tracker

## Goal: A polished, small full-stack app showing your ability to:
Build with Quarkus and Vue.js
Work like an open source contributor (issues, reviews, commits)
Handle both frontend and backend tasks

## Setup project (quarkus:dev, RESTEasy)
Create Task entity with fields:
id, title, description, status
Implement basic REST endpoints:
GET /tasks
POST /tasks
PUT /tasks/{id} (to update status)

## Create a Vue app with:
Task input form
Task list view
Status dropdown for each task (e.g., "open", "in progress", "done")
Fetch data from Quarkus REST API using Axios
